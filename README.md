# Scape-Room-test

This was a project that I did on CODEDEX to study a little bit of JAVA.

This was one of the exercise that I realized today using Scanner, the thing that I learned was that when we create the 

String answer = “”; 

We only create the variable, but in the whiel cycle we change his value with

answer = scanner.nextLine(); 

Here is where the user change the value of answer so we can judge with that new value if the answer is good or not
